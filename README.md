Note: params_millions is the number of parameters a model has in millions. It is inferred based on the model name and is not entirely accurate. Outliers are usually errors.

Note: Downloads is based on the number of downloads a model received in the last month. This weights the number towards currently trending models slightly. However, popular mainstay models should enjoy a large number of downloads regardless of the month.
